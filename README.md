**Auto Pickup** is a simple, lightweight, server-side Fabric mod that automatically places items and experience orbs from broken blocks directly into your inventory. No more chasing drops, no more lost items.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Instant Collection:** Items and experience from broken blocks are instantly added to your inventory and experience bar.
*   **Automatic Experience:** Experience orbs are collected directly, without ever spawning as entities.
*   **Lag-Free:** Prevents item and experience orb entities from spawning in the world, which can help reduce server lag.
*   **Smart Handling:** If your inventory is full, items will be **ejected from your player** with a "spitting" effect, similar to when items are left in a crafting table and your inventory is full upon exiting.
*   **Simple Configuration:** Easily enable or disable the feature for all players using a single gamerule.
*   **High Compatibility:** Designed to work with vanilla mechanics and other mods.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration via GameRule

The entire mod is controlled by a single gamerule, which can be changed by any server operator or in single-player worlds with cheats enabled.

*   **To enable Auto Pickup (Default):**
    ```
    /gamerule autoPickup true
    ```

*   **To disable Auto Pickup:**
    ```
    /gamerule autoPickup false
    ```

This setting applies to all players on the server.

## üì¶ Installation

This is a standard Fabric mod.

1.  Ensure you have [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) installed.
2.  Download the **Fabric API** and place it in your `mods` folder.
3.  Download the **Auto Pickup** JAR from the releases page.
4.  Place the `auto-pickup-x.x.x.jar` file into your `mods` folder.

That's it! The mod is purely server-side, but it will also work in single-player.

## ‚úÖ Compatibility

Auto Pickup is designed to be highly compatible with the modded ecosystem.

*   **Veinminer:** This mod includes a built-in, no-hassle compatibility layer for [MiraculixxT's Veinminer](https://modrinth.com/datapack/veinminer). All items and experience from blocks broken as part of a veinmine action will be correctly processed by Auto Pickup.
*   **Other Mods:** It should work seamlessly with most mods that use standard block-breaking and drop mechanics. If you find an incompatibility, please [open an issue](https://github.com/lukarbonite/autopickup/issues)!

## üë©‚Äçüíª For Developers: Using the API

If your mod features custom logic for breaking blocks or dropping items, you can easily integrate with Auto Pickup to provide your users with a seamless experience.

**1. Add Auto Pickup as a Dependency (build.gradle)**

It is recommended to use `modCompileOnly` so your mod doesn't require Autopickup to be installed.

```groovy
repositories {
    // ...
}

dependencies {
    // ...
    modCompileOnly "com.lukarbonite:auto-pickup:x.x.x" // Replace with the correct group/version
}
```

**2. Using the API**

The `AutoPickupApi` class provides simple, static methods to process drops.

### Handling Items

If you only need to process item drops, you can pass your calculated list of `ItemStack`s to `tryPickup`. It will return a list of any items that could not be picked up.

```java
import com.lukarbonite.autopickup.AutoPickupApi;
import net.fabricmc.loader.api.FabricLoader;

// ...

public void yourCustomDropMethod(PlayerEntity player, List<ItemStack> yourCalculatedDrops) {
    List<ItemStack> remainingDrops = yourCalculatedDrops;

    // Check if Auto Pickup is installed before calling its API
    if (FabricLoader.getInstance().isModLoaded("auto-pickup")) {
        // Let Auto Pickup try to handle the items
        remainingDrops = AutoPickupApi.tryPickup(player, yourCalculatedDrops);
    }

    // Drop any items that weren't picked up (e.g., inventory full)
    for (ItemStack stack : remainingDrops) {
        // Your logic to drop items in the world
        player.dropItem(stack, true);
    }
}
```

### Handling Items and Experience

To ensure both items and experience are automatically picked up, you need to provide a "context" for who is breaking the block. This allows Auto Pickup to intercept vanilla's experience drop logic.

Use `AutoPickupApi.setBlockBreaker(player)` before your drop logic and `AutoPickupApi.clearBlockBreaker()` in a `finally` block to ensure it's always cleaned up.

```java
import com.lukarbonite.autopickup.AutoPickupApi;
import net.fabricmc.loader.api.FabricLoader;

// ...

// Example for a custom block-breaking method
public void yourFullDropMethod(BlockState state, ServerWorld world, BlockPos pos, PlayerEntity player, ItemStack tool) {
    // Don't run this logic if Auto Pickup isn't loaded
    if (!FabricLoader.getInstance().isModLoaded("auto-pickup")) {
        // Your default drop logic here
        return;
    }

    // Set the player context so Auto Pickup can capture XP drops
    AutoPickupApi.setBlockBreaker(player);
    try {
        // 1. Calculate item drops
        List<ItemStack> drops = Block.getDroppedStacks(state, world, pos, null, player, tool);

        // 2. Let Auto Pickup try to pick them up
        List<ItemStack> remainingDrops = AutoPickupApi.tryPickup(player, drops);

        // 3. Drop any items that couldn't be picked up
        for (ItemStack stack : remainingDrops) {
            player.dropItem(stack, true);
        }

        // 4. Trigger vanilla experience drop logic (which Auto Pickup will intercept)
        state.onStacksDropped(world, pos, tool, true);

    } finally {
        // 5. IMPORTANT: Always clear the context
        AutoPickupApi.clearBlockBreaker();
    }

    // Your other logic for after the block is broken (e.g., setting the block to air)
    // ...
}
```
